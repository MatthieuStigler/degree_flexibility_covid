# Replication code for the paper Researchersâ€™ Degrees of Flexibility: Revisiting COVID-19 Policy Evaluations

The code is written in R, and uses an Rstudio R project which will take care of the relative paths of the different files. 
It is there recommended to run the script from Rstudio by loading the Rproject `degree_flexibility_covid.Rproj`.

The code is also hosted on https://github.com/MatthieuStigler/degree_flexibility_covid (but only the code), this is done to allow to make eventual updates to the code if mistakes are discovered.
